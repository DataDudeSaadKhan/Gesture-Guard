# GestureGuard: AI-Powered Sign Language Detection

GestureGuard is an innovative project that utilizes artificial intelligence (AI) and deep learning techniques to detect and interpret sign language gestures in real-time. By leveraging advanced computer vision algorithms and LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural networks, GestureGuard aims to bridge communication gaps for individuals with hearing impairments by providing an intuitive and accessible means of understanding and communicating through sign language.

## Features

- Real-time sign language detection using webcam feed
- Support for multiple sign language gestures and actions
- Accurate and robust performance, even in varying lighting conditions
- Easy-to-use interface with intuitive visual feedback

## Introduction

GestureGuard is developed with the mission of making sign language interpretation more accessible and inclusive. Traditional methods of sign language interpretation often rely on human interpreters, which may not always be available or practical in every situation. By harnessing the power of AI and computer vision, GestureGuard offers a scalable and efficient solution that can be deployed across various platforms and environments.

## Installation

To use GestureGuard, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/DataDudeSaadKhan/GestureGuard.git
   cd GestureGuard
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the project:
   - Execute the main script:
     ```
     python main.py
     ```

## Usage

GestureGuard provides a user-friendly interface for sign language detection. Simply launch the application, and it will start capturing the webcam feed in real-time. Perform sign language gestures within the camera's view, and GestureGuard will recognize and interpret the gestures accordingly. The detected gestures are displayed on the screen, providing instant feedback to the user.
